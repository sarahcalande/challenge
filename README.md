Because I was given the option between parsing the Google Doc itself and downloading
the spreadsheet and parsing it from there, I made two separate JS files to show the
versatility and possibility of using either option. Please see the index.html and separately comment in/out
the files as you would like to test them. I left CSVindex.js commented it, so that will run first until
it is commented out and replaced with the other script tag. Please see the comments in each JS file
for more specific information.
